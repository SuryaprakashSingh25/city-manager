# City Manager – Microservices Backend System

City Manager is a backend system for managing and tracking city-level issues
reported by citizens and handled by staff members. Users register with default
**CITIZEN** access, while a pre-bootstrapped **ADMIN** manages role elevation to
**STAFF**. The system supports **pagination, sorting, and filtering** for efficient
data access across large datasets.

> This project is designed for local execution to demonstrate system design,
> service interaction, and production-like behavior. Cloud deployment and CI/CD
> are intentionally out of scope.

## 📌 Functional Overview

- Users register with default **CITIZEN** access
- A bootstrapped **ADMIN** manages role assignments
- Citizens can report city-related issues with media attachments
- Staff members review, take ownership, and resolve reported issues
- APIs support **pagination, sorting, and filtering** for scalable data retrieval
- Notifications are sent asynchronously for key actions

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system follows a **distributed microservices architecture** with:

- API Gateway for centralized request routing
- Eureka Service Discovery for dynamic service registration
- Centralized Configuration Server (Spring Cloud Config)
- JWT-based authentication with role-based authorization
- Apache Kafka for asynchronous, event-driven workflows
- Redis for distributed locking and concurrency control
- Swagger / OpenAPI for API documentation
- Dockerized local infrastructure (Kafka, Zookeeper, Redis)
- Domain-driven microservices with clear separation of concerns

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud (Config Server, Eureka, API Gateway)
- Spring Security + JWT
- Apache Kafka
- Redis (locking & concurrency control)
- MongoDB Atlas
- Swagger / OpenAPI
- Maven (multi-module project)

### Frontend
- Angular

### Infrastructure & Tooling
- Docker
- Kafka + Zookeeper (local)
- Redis (local)
- AWS S3 (media storage)
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🔐 Security (JWT)

- Stateless authentication using **JWT**
- Role-based access control (**CITIZEN**, **STAFF**, **ADMIN**)
- Access and refresh token mechanism
- Token validation enforced at Gateway and service levels

---

## 🔄 Event-Driven Communication (Kafka)

- Kafka is used for **asynchronous workflows** across services
- Domain events are published on key actions (e.g., issue creation)
- Notification workflows are handled via Kafka consumers
- Shared event schemas are defined in the `event-contracts` module
- Enables loose coupling and scalable communication

---

## 🚀 Distributed Locking (Redis)

- Redis is used to implement **distributed locking**
- Prevents race conditions when multiple users act on the same issue
- Ensures data consistency under concurrent access

---

## ☁️ Media Storage (AWS S3)

- Media files are stored in **AWS S3**
- Backend services handle secure upload and retrieval
- Keeps large binary data out of core databases

---

## 📘 API Documentation (Swagger)

- Swagger / OpenAPI is enabled for all microservices
- Provides interactive API exploration and testing

---

## ⚙️ Centralized Configuration

Service configurations are externalized using Spring Cloud Config.

**Config Repository:**  
https://github.com/SuryaprakashSingh25/cpims-config-repo

**Benefits:**
- Environment-specific configuration
- Clean separation of configuration from code
- Simplified configuration updates
